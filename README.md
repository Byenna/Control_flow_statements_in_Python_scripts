A few hands-on Scripts to help you practice writing simple Python scripts

**Check the README.md of the specific branch for guidance**

Script 1: Grade Calculator
Write a Python script that takes a student's score as input and outputs their corresponding grade based on the following criteria:
```
A score of 90 or above gets an 'A'
A score between 80 and 89 gets a 'B'
A score between 70 and 79 gets a 'C'
A score between 60 and 69 gets a 'D'
A score below 60 gets an 'F'
```
Script 2: Leap Year Checker
Write a Python script that prompts the user to enter a year and determines whether it is a leap year or not. A leap year is divisible by 4 but not by 100, except for years that are divisible by 400. The script should print "Leap year" or "Not a leap year" accordingly.

Script 3: Guess the Number
Write a Python script that generates a random number between 1 and 100 and lets the user guess the number. The script should provide feedback to the user after each guess, indicating whether their guess was too high, too low, or correct. The script should continue until the user guesses the correct number.

Script 4: Fibonacci Series
Write a Python script that takes a number 'n' as input and prints the Fibonacci series up to the 'n'th term. The Fibonacci series starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent term is the sum of the two preceding terms.

Script 5: Palindrome Checker
Write a Python script that prompts the user to enter a string and checks whether the string is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward.
